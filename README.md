# HashPatcher
Patch MD5 Hash through HarmonyLib. Made by https://t.me/cabboshiba

# How it works

Using HarmonyLib (https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/patching.html), this Program patches System.IO.File.OpenRead Method with a different FilePath.

Original Hash Path: xxx.exe

After the patch, it will became: aaa.exe

Can be used to bypass MD5 Hash Check.
