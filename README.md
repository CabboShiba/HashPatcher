# HashPatcher
Patch MD5 Hash through HarmonyLib. Made by https://t.me/cabboshiba

# How it works

Using HarmonyLib (https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/patching.html), this Program patches System.IO.File.OpenRead Method with a different FilePath.

Original Hash Path: xxx.exe

After the patch, it will became: aaa.exe

Can be used to bypass MD5 Hash Check.

NOTE (3 hours after release): Hi. Since I was working on Mazk Hash Checker, I focused the program only on FilePath Hook, but not the Hash String itself. Pleasd expect an update tomorrow (16/09/2022). You will be able to Hook File used to check hash (available in this release) but also the Hash String (available tomorrow, probably).
